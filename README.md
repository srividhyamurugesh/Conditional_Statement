Conditional Statements in Python
**Overview**
   Conditional statements in Python are used to execute a block of code based on specific conditions. They help in decision-making within a program by evaluating expressions that result 
   in True or False.

**Types of Conditional Statements**
1. if statement: Executes a block of code if the condition is true.

2. if-else statement: Executes one block if the condition is true, otherwise executes another block.

3. if-elif-else statement: Checks multiple conditions sequentially and executes the corresponding block for the first true condition.

4. Nested if statement: An if statement inside another if statement.

5. Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator): A concise way to write simple if-else conditions.

**Keys to Remember:**
   1. Indentation is crucial in Python and determines the code block associated with each conditional statement.
   2. Conditions are evaluated as True or False based on expressions or variables.
   3. Use logical operators (and, or, not) to combine multiple conditions.
   4. Nested if statements are used when you need to check more than one condition at a time.
